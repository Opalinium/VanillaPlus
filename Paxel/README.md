# Paxel

A paxel is a multi-tool that combines the pickaxe, axe, and shovel into one tool.

There is a paxel for every tool tier: wooden, stone, iron, golden, diamond, and netherite.

## Features
- Seamless multi-tool usage
- Craftable, repairable, enchantable, and smith-able
- Unlockable recipes
- No permissions management required*
- Admin command to give players paxels (/givepaxel)
- Can be easily retextured using CustomModelData -- values are editable in the config to prevent conflicts

## Recipe
![Recipe for crafting a paxel tool.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PoorgrammerDev/VanillaPlus/media/paxel-crafting.png)

The recipe shown above is for the diamond paxel, but the pattern is the same for every tier of paxels. The three tools must be all the same tier.

Netherite Paxels can also be obtained by upgrading a Diamond Paxel in a Smithing Table.
