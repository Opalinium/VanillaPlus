# VanillaPlus

VanillaPlus is a collection of Spigot plugins designed to enhance the vanilla Minecraft survival experience.

The common themes of all VanillaPlus plugins are:
- Survival friendliness
- Minimal required commands and interfaces
- No required permissions management

The motivation behind these themes is that these features should complement or extend Minecraft's game loop without disrupting the flow of the game.

The available plugins are listed below, as well as their brief descriptions. Each plugin's title is linked to its SpigotMC resource page which has more information.

### [Paxel](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/paxel.110810/ "SpigotMC resource page for this plugin")
Introduces multi-tools that combine the pickaxe, axe, and shovel into one tool. There is one for each tool tier.

### [Hammer]()
Introduces special pickaxes that can mine in a 3x3 area. There is one for each tool tier.

### [RecoveryTotem]()
Adds a craftable consumable Totem that provides a one-time keepInventory on death.

### [OminousWither]()
Adds harder variants of the Wither boss, summoned by having Bad Omen when building the Wither.

### [DispensersShearPumpkins]()

## Scalability and Compatibility

These plugins are intended for small to medium SMP (survival multiplayer) Spigot and Paper servers.

A lack of complex permissions management and control may be undesirable for larger servers.

Furthermore, compatibility with other non-VanillaPlus plugins may be limited.
