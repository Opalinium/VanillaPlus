# VanillaPlus

VanillaPlus is a collection of Spigot plugins designed to enhance the vanilla Minecraft survival experience.

The common themes of all VanillaPlus plugins are:
- Survival friendliness
- Minimal required commands and interfaces
- No required permissions management

The motivation behind these themes is that these features should complement or extend Minecraft's game loop without disrupting the flow of the game.

The available plugins are listed below, as well as their brief descriptions. Each plugin's title is linked to its own README page with more info.

### [Paxel](./Paxel/README.md)

### [Hammer](./Hammer/README.md)
Introduces craftable pickaxes for each tool tier that mine in a 3x3 area.

### [RecoveryTotem](./RecoveryTotem/README.md)

## Scalability and Compatibility

These plugins are intended for small to medium SMP (survival multiplayer) Spigot and Paper servers.

A lack of complex permissions management and control may be undesirable for larger servers.

Furthermore, compatibility with other non-VanillaPlus plugins may be limited.
