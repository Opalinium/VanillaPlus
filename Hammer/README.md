# [Hammer]()

A hammer is a tool that breaks blocks in a 3x3 plane. It is a special type of pickaxe, so it is used on pickaxe-breakable blocks.

There is a hammer for every tool tier: wooden, stone, iron, golden, diamond, and netherite.

## Features
- Respects Unbreaking, Fortune, and Silk Touch enchantments

- Craftable, repairable, enchantable, and smith-able
- Unlockable recipes
- No permissions management required*
- Admin command to give players hammers (/givehammer)
- Can be easily retextured using CustomModelData -- values are editable in the config to prevent conflicts
- Configurable gameplay values (e.g. hunger rate, block hardness range)
